# Daily Positive Thoughts Daily Emails

I created this project because I wanted to receive personalized encouraging messages every day. Sometimes we all need a little positivity in our inbox! The system uses AI to generate uplifting messages.

## Want to Join Me?

If you'd also like to receive daily positive thoughts:
- Fill out this form: [Daily Positive Thoughts Signup](https://forms.gle/SzCf7zVF5KtvndNh6)
- Get daily personalized messages

**Note:** This is my fun side project - I'll keep it running as long as I can, but no guarantees! You can unsubscribe anytime by replying "UNSUBSCRIBE" to any email.

## How It Works

1. You tell me what's been on your mind through the Google Form
2. The system uses Mistral AI to craft a personalized encouraging message
3. You get a daily email with positive thoughts
4. Unsubscribe anytime if you no longer want the messages
